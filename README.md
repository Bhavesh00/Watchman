# SecurityOpenCV


## Things we will need for website:
1. Brief description - Motivation behind the app (e.g. changing the way we look at global home security)
- link to source code
2. Video showcasing the project
3. Getting started
  - Main features
  - Limitations
  - Hardware support
4. Documentation page teaching them how to contribute

## Minimal viable product description
1. Video feed passed into OpenCV Nerual Net
2. When face is detected, if not in local dataset of known images, start recording
3. Save recording locally.
